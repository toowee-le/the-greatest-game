## Project Aims

##Â Getting Started

### System Requirements

`python 3.9` and the Python package installer `pip` are required to play Treasure Forest locally.

If you do not have the latest Python version, you will need to install or update it.

To check if your system has these requirements, open your operating system's terminal and run:

```
# Check Python version. You should see the output 3.9.1 or above
python3 --version

# Check if the Python package installer is installed
pip3 --version
```

### Game installation

Open your operating system's terminal and run the following commands:

```
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/toowee-le/the-greatest-game.git

# Change directory into the cloned directory
cd the-greatest-game
```

## Begin the game

To run the game, make sure you are in the `the-greatest-game` root directory and run `python main.py`. To quit the game, press the 'X' button on the start menu or simply close the window.
